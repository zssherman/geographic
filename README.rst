Geographic Maps, Basemap and Cartopy
====================================

Using Py-ART's modules RadarMapDisplay and RadarMapDisplayCartopy to create examples and test both modules to see if they work. RadarMapDisplay, testing if basemap.bluemarble() works correctly.

The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, `Py-ART <http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/>`_, is a Python module containing a collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities. Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility for working with data from a number of its precipitation and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze data from many types of weather radars.
